Before you write an entry in your learning log, think about where and how you use data to make decisions. You will create a list of at least five questions that you might use data to answer. Here are a few examples to inspire you:

1. What’s the best time to go to the gym?

2. How does the length of your commute to work vary by day of the week?

3. How many cups of coffee do you drink each day?

4. What flavor of ice cream do customers buy?

5. How many hours of sleep do you get each day? 

Then, you will select one of the five questions from your list to explore further and write down the types of data you might collect in order to make a decision. That’s data analysis in action!

## Case Study

how can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees? 

#### Ask:

        What do you think new employees need to learn to be successful in their first year on the job? 

        Have you gathered data from new employees before? If so, may we have access to the historical data?

        Do you believe managers with higher retention rates offer new employees something extra or unique?

        What do you suspect is a leading cause of dissatisfaction among new employees?

        By what percentage would you like employee retention to increase in the next fiscal year?

#### PREPARATION

It all started with solid preparation. The group built a timeline of three months and decided how they wanted to relay their progress to interested parties. Also during this step, the analysts identified what data they needed to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step - in this case, the analysts chose to gather the data from an online survey of new employees. These were the things they did to prepare:

        They developed specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction with different business processes, such as hiring and onboarding, and their overall compensation. 

        They established rules for who would have access to the data collected - in this case, anyone outside the group wouldn't have access to the raw data, but could view summarized or aggregated data. For example, an individual's compensation wouldn't be available, but salary ranges for groups of individuals would be viewable. 

        They finalized what specific information would be gathered, and how best to present the data visually. The analysts brainstormed possible project- and data-related issues and how to avoid them. 

#### PROCESS

The group sent the survey out. Great analysts know how to respect both their data and the people who provide it. Since employees provided the data, it was important to make sure all employees gave their consent to participate. The data analysts also made sure employees understood how their data would be collected, stored, managed, and protected. Collecting and using data ethically is one of the responsibilities of data analysts. In order to maintain confidentiality and protect and store the data effectively, these were the steps they took:

        They restricted access to the data to a limited number of analysts. 

        They cleaned the data to make sure it was complete, correct, and relevant. Certain data was aggregated and summarized without revealing individual responses. 

        They uploaded raw data to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security. 

#### ANALYZE

Then, the analysts did what they do best: analyze! From the completed surveys, the data analysts discovered that an employee’s experience with certain processes was a key indicator of overall job satisfaction. These were their findings:

        Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process were most likely to leave the company. 

        Employees who experienced an efficient and transparent evaluation and feedback process were most likely to remain with the company. 

The group knew it was important to document exactly what they found in the analysis, no matter what the results. To do otherwise would diminish trust in the survey process and reduce their ability to collect truthful data from employees in the future. 

#### SHARE

Just as they made sure the data was carefully protected, the analysts were also careful sharing the report. This is how they shared their findings:

        They shared the report with managers who met or exceeded the minimum number of direct reports with submitted responses to the survey. 

        They presented the results to the managers to make sure they had the full picture. 

        They asked the managers to personally deliver the results to their teams. 

This process gave managers an opportunity to communicate the results with the right context. As a result, they could have productive team conversations about next steps to improve employee engagement. 


#### ACT

The last stage of the process for the team of analysts was to work with leaders within their company and decide how best to implement changes and take actions based on the findings. These were their recommendations: 

        Standardize the hiring and evaluation process for employees based on the most efficient and transparent practices. 

        Conduct the same survey annually and compare results with those from the previous year. 

A year later, the same survey was distributed to employees. Analysts anticipated that a comparison between the two sets of results would indicate that the action plan worked. Turns out, the changes improved the retention rate for new employees and the actions taken by leaders were successful!

## Beyond the Numbers: A Data Analyst Journey | Anna Leach | TEDxPSU

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2oOFs4WgI0

## Data analysts typically work with six problem types

Making predictions 
A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.

Categorizing things 
An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.

Spotting something unusual 
A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.

Identifying themes 
User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes. 

By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes. The best way to think about it is: categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.

Discovering connections 
A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries. 

Finding patterns
Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window.

# Course #2:


## Examples of SMART questions

Here's an example that breaks down the thought process of turning a problem question into one or more SMART questions using the SMART method: What features do people look for when buying a new car?

Specific: Does the question focus on a particular car feature?

Measurable: Does the question include a feature rating system?

Action-oriented: Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?

Relevant: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?

Time-bound: Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years? 

Questions should be open-ended. This is the best way to get responses that will help you accurately qualify or disqualify potential solutions to your specific problem. So, based on the thought process, possible SMART questions might be:

On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the most important) how important is your car having four-wheel drive?

What are the top five features you would like to see in a car package?

What features, if included with four-wheel drive, would make you more inclined to buy the car?

How much more would you pay for a car with four-wheel drive?

Has four-wheel drive become more or less popular in the last three years?

Things to avoid when asking questions
Leading questions: questions that only have a particular response

Example: This product is too expensive, isn’t it?

This is a leading question because it suggests an answer as part of the question. A better question might be, “What is your opinion of this product?” There are tons of answers to that question, and they could include information about usability, features, accessories, color, reliability, and popularity, on top of price. Now, if your problem is actually focused on pricing, you could ask a question like “What price (or price range) would make you consider purchasing this product?” This question would provide a lot of different measurable responses.

Closed-ended questions: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only

Example: Were you satisfied with the customer trial?

This is a closed-ended question because it doesn’t encourage people to expand on their answer. It is really easy for them to give one-word responses that aren’t very informative. A better question might be, “What did you learn about customer experience from the trial.” This encourages people to provide more detail besides “It went well.”

Vague questions: questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context

Example: Does the tool work for you?

This question is too vague because there is no context. Is it about comparing the new tool to the one it replaces? You just don’t know. A better inquiry might be, “When it comes to data entry, is the new tool faster, slower, or about the same as the old tool? If faster, how much time is saved? If slower, how much time is lost?” These questions give context (data entry) and help frame responses that are measurable (time).


## Related question topics

Some common topics for questions include: 

Objectives

Audience

Time

Resources

Security

Think about how you can ask SMART questions about each of these topics.

```
Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good reflection on this topic would describe how you applied SMART questions to the scenario.

Here are a few questions you might want to ask:

When is the project due?

Are there any specific challenges to keep in mind? 

Who are the major stakeholders for this project, and what do they expect this project to do for them?

Who am I presenting the results to?

Here are some examples of questions you might ask based on the suggested topics:

Objectives: What are the goals of the deep dive? What, if any, questions are expected to be answered by this deep dive?

Audience: Who are the stakeholders? Who is interested or concerned about the results of this deep dive? Who is the audience for the presentation?

Time: What is the time frame for completion? By what date does this need to be done?

Resources: What resources are available to accomplish the deep dive's goals?

Security: Who should have access to the information?

These questions can help you focus on techniques and analyses that produce results of interest to stakeholders. They also clarify the deliverable’s due date, which is important to know so you can manage your time effectively. When you start work on a project, you need to ask questions that align with the plan and the goals and help you explore the data. The more questions you ask, the more you learn about your data, and the more powerful your insights will be.

Asking thorough and specific questions means clarifying details until you get to concrete requirements. With clear requirements and goals, it’s much easier to plan and execute a successful data analysis project and avoid time-consuming problems down the road.

EXAMPLES

For instance, if you have a conversation with someone who works in retail, you might lead with questions like: 

Specific: Do you currently use data to drive decisions in your business? If so, what kind(s) of data do you collect, and how do you use it?

Measurable: Do you know what percentage of sales is from your top-selling products?

Action-oriented: Are there business decisions or changes that you would make if you had the right information? For example, if you had information about how umbrella sales change with the weather, how would you use it?

Relevant: How often do you review data from your business?

Time-bound: Can you describe how data helped you make good decisions for your store(s) this past year?

If you are having a conversation with a teacher, you might ask different questions, such as: 

Specific: What kind of data do you use to build your lessons?

Measurable: How well do student benchmark test scores correlate with their grades?

Action-oriented: Do you share your data with other teachers to improve lessons?

Relevant: Have you shared grading data with an entire class? If so, do students seem to be more or less motivated, or about the same?

Time-bound: In the last five years, how many times did you review data from previous academic years?

If you are having a conversation with a small business owner of an ice cream shop, you could ask:

Specific: What data do you use to help with purchasing and inventory?

Measurable: Can you order (rank) these factors from most to least influential on sales: price, flavor, and time of year (season)?

Action-oriented: Is there a single factor you need more data on so you can potentially increase sales?

Relevant: How do you advertise to or communicate with customers?

Time-bound: What does your year-over-year sales growth look like for the last three years?

```

## Quantitative and Qualitative Data

Data analysts will generally use both types of data in their work. Usually, qualitative data can help analysts better understand their quantitative data by providing a reason or more thorough explanation. In other words, quantitative data generally gives you the what, and qualitative data generally gives you the why. By using both quantitative and qualitative data, you can learn when people like to go to the movies and why they chose the theater. Maybe they really like the reclining chairs, so your manager can purchase more recliners. Maybe the theater is the only one that serves root beer. Maybe a later show time gives them more time to drive to the theater from where popular restaurants are located. Maybe they go to matinees because they have kids and want to save money. You wouldn’t have discovered this information by analyzing only the quantitative data for attendance, profit, and showtimes.


## Spreadsheet and Data Life Cycle

Plan for the users who will work within a spreadsheet by developing organizational standards. This can mean formatting your cells, the headings you choose to highlight, the color scheme, and the way you order your data points. When you take the time to set these standards, you will improve communication, ensure consistency, and help people be more efficient with their time.

Capture data by the source by connecting spreadsheets to other data sources, such as an online survey application or a database. This data will automatically be updated in the spreadsheet. That way, the information is always as current and accurate as possible.

Manage different kinds of data with a spreadsheet. This can involve storing, organizing, filtering, and updating information. Spreadsheets also let you decide who can access the data, how the information is shared, and how to keep your data safe and secure. 

Analyze data in a spreadsheet to help make better decisions. Some of the most common spreadsheet analysis tools include formulas to aggregate data or create reports, and pivot tables for clear, easy-to-understand visuals. 

Archive any spreadsheet that you don’t use often, but might need to reference later with built-in tools. This is especially useful if you want to store historical data before it gets updated. 

Destroy your spreadsheet when you are certain that you will never need it again, if you have better backup copies, or for legal or security reasons. Keep in mind, lots of businesses are required to follow certain rules or have measures in place to make sure data is destroyed properly.	


## Spreadsheet and its error

#DIV/0!

A formula is trying to divide a value in a cell by 0 (or an empty cell with no value)

=B2/B3, when the cell B3 contains the value 0 

#ERROR!

(Google Sheets only)  Something can’t be interpreted as it has been input. This is also known as a parsing error. 

=COUNT(B1:D1 C1:C10) is invalid because the cell ranges aren't separated by a comma

#N/A

A formula can't find the data 

The cell being referenced can't be found 

#NAME?

The name of a formula or function used isn't recognized

The name of a function is misspelled 

#NUM!

The spreadsheet can't perform a formula calculation because a cell has an invalid numeric value

=DATEDIF(A4, B4, "M")  is unable to calculate the number of months between two dates because the date in cell A4 falls after the date in cell B4

#REF!

A formula is referencing a cell that isn't valid

A cell used in a formula was in a column that was deleted

#VALUE!

A general error indicating a problem with a formula or with referenced cells

There could be problems with spaces or text, or with referenced cells in a formula; you may have additional work to find the source of the problem.


## Scope of Work

At this point, try not to confuse statement of work with scope of work, which are both abbreviated as SOW. Although they both are used to define deliverables and a timeline, they aren't the same and shouldn't be used interchangeably.

A statement of work is a document that clearly identifies the products and services a vendor or contractor will provide to an organization. It includes objectives, guidelines, deliverables, schedule, and costs. 

A scope of work is project-based and sets the expectations and boundaries of a project. A scope of work may be included in a statement of work to help define project outcomes. 

As a junior data analyst, It's more typical to be asked to create a scope of work than a statement of work.

## Context can turn raw data into meaningful information. It is very important for data analysts to contextualize their data. This means giving the data perspective by defining it. To do this, you need to identify:

Who: The person or organization that created, collected, and/or funded the data collection

What: The things in the world that data could have an impact on

Where: The origin of the data

When: The time when the data was created or collected

Why: The motivation behind the creation or collection

How: The method used to create or collect it

Understanding and including the context is important during each step of your analysis process, so it is a good idea to get comfortable with it early in your career. For example, when you collect data, you’ll also want to ask questions about the context to make sure that you understand the business and business process. During organization, the context is important for your naming conventions, how you choose to show relationships between variables, and what you choose to keep or leave out. And finally, when you present, it is important to include contextual information so that your stakeholders understand your analysis.


# Working with stakeholders
Your data analysis project should answer the business task and create opportunities for data-driven decision-making. That's why it is so important to focus on project stakeholders. As a data analyst, it is your responsibility to understand and manage your stakeholders’ expectations while keeping the project goals front and center.

 
You might remember that stakeholders are people who have invested time, interest, and resources into the projects that you are  working on. This can be a pretty broad group, and your project stakeholders may change from project to project. But there are three common stakeholder groups that you might find yourself working with: the executive team, the customer-facing team, and the data science team.

Let’s get to know more about the different stakeholders and their goals. Then we'll learn some tips for communicating with them effectively.

Executive team
The executive team provides strategic and operational leadership to the company. They set goals, develop strategy, and make sure that strategy is executed effectively. The executive team might include vice presidents, the chief marketing officer, and senior-level professionals who help plan and direct the company’s work. These stakeholders think about decisions at a very high level and they are looking for the headline news about your project first.  They are less interested in the details. Time is very limited with them, so make the most of it by leading your presentations with the answers to their questions. You can keep the more detailed information handy in your presentation appendix or your project documentation for them to dig into when they have more time. 

For example, you might find yourself working with the vice president of human resources on an analysis project to understand the rate of employee absences. A marketing director might look to you for competitive analyses. Part of your job will be balancing what information they will need to make informed decisions with their busy schedule. 

But you don’t have to tackle that by yourself. Your project manager will be overseeing the progress of the entire team, and you will be giving them more regular updates than someone like the vice president of HR. They are able to give you what you need to move forward on a project, including getting approvals from the busy executive team. Working closely with your project manager can help you pinpoint the needs of the executive stakeholders for your project, so don’t be afraid to ask them for guidance. 


Customer-facing team
The customer-facing team includes anyone in an organization who has some level of interaction with customers and potential customers. Typically they compile information, set expectations, and communicate customer feedback to other parts of the internal organization. These stakeholders have their own objectives and may come to you with specific asks. It is important to let the data tell the story and not be swayed by asks from your stakeholders to find certain patterns that might not exist. 

Let’s say a customer-facing team is working with you to build a new version of a company’s most popular product. Part of your work might involve collecting and sharing data about consumers’ buying behavior to help inform product features. Here, you want to be sure that your analysis and presentation focuses on what is actually in the data-- not on what your stakeholders hope to find. 


Data science team
Organizing data within a company takes teamwork. There's a good chance you'll find yourself working with other data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. For example, maybe you team up with a company's data science team to work on boosting company engagement to lower rates of employee turnover. In that case, you might look into the data on employee productivity, while another analyst looks at hiring data. Then you share those findings with the data scientist on your team, who uses them to predict how new processes could boost employee productivity and engagement. When you share what you found in your individual analyses, you uncover the bigger story. A big part of your job will be collaborating with other data team members to find new angles of the data to explore. Here's a view of how  different roles on a typical data science team support different functions:

Venn diagram with three overlapping circles: Mathematics and statistics, Computer science, and Business domain knowledge

Working effectively with stakeholders
When you're working with each group of stakeholders- from the executive team, to the customer-facing team, to the data science team, you'll often have to go beyond the data. Use the following tips to communicate clearly, establish trust, and deliver your findings across groups.

Discuss goals. Stakeholder requests are often tied to a bigger project or goal. When they ask you for something, take the opportunity to learn more. Start a discussion. Ask about the kind of results the stakeholder wants. Sometimes, a quick chat about goals can help set expectations and plan the next steps.

Feel empowered to say “no.” Let’s say you are approached by a marketing director who has a “high-priority” project and needs data to back up their hypothesis. They ask you to produce the analysis and charts for a presentation by tomorrow morning. Maybe you realize their hypothesis isn’t fully formed and you have helpful ideas about a better way to approach the analysis. Or maybe you realize it will take more time and effort to perform the analysis than estimated. Whatever the case may be, don’t be afraid to push back when you need to. 

Image of two people sitting at a desk. One of them is on a laptop and the other is holding a coffee mug
Stakeholders don’t always realize the time and effort that goes into collecting and analyzing data. They also might not know what they actually need. You can help stakeholders by asking about their goals and determining whether you can deliver what they need. If you can’t, have the confidence to say “no,” and provide a respectful explanation. If there’s an option that would be more helpful, point the stakeholder toward those resources. If you find that you need to prioritize other projects first, discuss what you can prioritize and when. When your stakeholders understand what needs to be done and what can be accomplished in a given timeline, they will usually be comfortable resetting their expectations. You should feel empowered to say no-- just remember to give context so others understand why. 

Plan for the unexpected. Before you start a project, make a list of potential roadblocks. Then, when you discuss project expectations and timelines with your stakeholders, give yourself some extra time for problem-solving at each stage of the process.

Know your project. Keep track of your discussions about the project over email or reports, and be ready to answer questions about how certain aspects are important for your organization. Get to know how your project connects to the rest of the company and get involved in providing the most insight possible. If you have a good understanding about why you are doing an analysis, it can help you connect your work with other goals and be more effective at solving larger problems. 

Start with words and visuals. It is common for data analysts and stakeholders to interpret things in different ways while assuming the other is on the same page. This illusion of agreement* has been historically identified as a cause of projects going back-and-forth a number of times before a direction is finally nailed down. To help avoid this, start with a description and a quick visual of what you are trying to convey. Stakeholders have many points of view and may prefer to absorb information in words or pictures. Work with them to make changes and improvements from there. The faster everyone agrees, the faster you can perform the first analysis to test the usefulness of the project, measure the feedback, learn from the data, and implement changes.

Communicate often. Your stakeholders will want regular updates on your projects. Share notes about project milestones, setbacks, and changes. Then use your notes to create a shareable report. Another great resource to use is a change-log, which you will learn more throughout the program. For now, just know that a change-log is a file containing a chronologically ordered list of modifications made to a project. Depending on the way you set it up, stakeholders can even pop in and view updates whenever they want.

## Focus on What Matters
* Who is your primary and secondary stakeholder
* Who is managing the data
* Where can you go for help?

## Clear Communication
* Who your audience is
* What they already know
* What they need to know
* How you can communicate effectively to them


## About Communication

Here's an important first tip: Know your audience! When you communicate your analysis and recommendations as a data analyst, it's vital to keep your audience in mind. 

Be sure to answer these four important questions related to your audience:

Who is your audience? 

What do they already know? 

What do they need to know? 

How can you best communicate what they need to know?

## Data Ethics
* Ownership
* Transaction Transparency
* Consent
* Currency
* Openness
* Privacy


Data anonymization is used in just about every industry. That is why it is so important for data analysts to understand the basics. Here is a list of data that is often anonymized:

Telephone numbers

Names

License plates and license numbers

Social security numbers

IP addresses

Medical records

Email addresses

Photographs

Account numbers

For some people, it just makes sense that this type of data should be anonymized. For others, we have to be very specific about what needs to be anonymized. Imagine a world where we all had access to each other’s addresses, account numbers, and other identifiable information. That would invade a lot of people’s privacy and make the world less safe. Data anonymization is one of the ways we can keep data private and secure!


## Open Data
The open-data debate
Just like data privacy, open data is a widely debated topic in today’s world. Data analysts think a lot about open data, and as a future data analyst, you need to understand the basics to be successful in your new role. 

 Illustration of a scale balancing numerical data
What is open data?
In data analytics, open data is part of data ethics, which has to do with using data ethically. Openness refers to free access, usage, and sharing of data. But for data to be considered open, it has to:

Be available and accessible to the public as a complete dataset

Be provided under terms that allow it to be reused and redistributed

Allow universal participation so that anyone can use, reuse, and redistribute the data

Data can only be considered open when it meets all three of these standards. 

The open data debate: What data should be publicly available?
One of the biggest benefits of open data is that credible databases can be used more widely. Basically, this means that all of that good data can be leveraged, shared, and combined with other data. This could have a huge impact on scientific collaboration, research advances, analytical capacity, and decision-making. But it is important to think about the individuals being represented by the public, open data, too. 

Third-party data is collected by an entity that doesn’t have a direct relationship with the data. You might remember learning about this type of data earlier. For example, third parties might collect information about visitors to a certain website. Doing this lets these third parties create audience profiles, which helps them better understand user behavior and target them with more effective advertising. 

Personal identifiable information (PII) is data that is reasonably likely to identify a person and make information known about them. It is important to keep this data safe. PII can include a person’s address, credit card information, social security number, medical records, and more. 

Everyone wants to keep personal information about themselves private. Because third-party data is readily available, it is important to balance the openness of data with the privacy of individuals. 


## Elements of metadata

Before looking at metadata examples, it is important to understand what type of information metadata typically provides.

Title and description
What is the name of the file or website you are examining? What type of content does it contain?

Tags and categories
What is the general overview of the data that you have? Is the data indexed or described in a specific way? 

Who created it and when
Where did the data come from, and when was it created? Is it recent, or has it existed for a long time?

Who last modified it and when
Were any changes made to the data?  If yes, were the modifications recent?

Examples of metadata
In today’s digital world, metadata is everywhere, and it is becoming a more common practice to provide metadata on a lot of media and information you interact with. Here are some real-world examples of where to find metadata:

Photos
Whenever a photo is captured with a camera, metadata such as camera filename, date, time, and geolocation are gathered and saved with it.

Emails
When an email is sent or received, there is lots of visible metadata such as subject line, the sender, the recipient and date and time sent. There is also hidden metadata that includes server names, IP addresses, HTML format, and software details.

Spreadsheets and documents
Spreadsheets and documents are already filled with a considerable amount of data so it is no surprise that metadata would also accompany them. Titles, author, creation date, number of pages, user comments as well as names of tabs, tables, and columns are all metadata that one can find in spreadsheets and documents. 

Websites
Every web page has a number of standard metadata fields, such as tags and categories, site creator’s name, web page title and description, time of creation and any iconography. 

Digital files
Usually, if you right click on any computer file, you will see its metadata. This could consist of file name, file size, date of creation and modification, and type of file. 

Books
Metadata is not only digital. Every book has a number of standard metadata on the covers and inside that will inform you of its title, author’s name, a table of contents, publisher information, copyright description, index, and a brief description of the book’s contents.

Data as you know it
Knowing the content and context of your data, as well as how it is structured, is very valuable in your career as a data analyst. When analyzing data, it is important to always understand the full picture. It is not just about the data you are viewing, but how that data comes together. Metadata ensures that you are able to find, use, preserve, and reuse data in the future. Remember, it will be your responsibility to manage and make use of data in its entirety; metadata is as important as the data itself.

# Course 4: Processing Data From Dirty to Clean
A good analysis depends on the integrity of the data, and **data integrity usually depends on using a common format. So it is important to double-check how dates are formatted to make sure what you think is December 10, 2020 isn’t really October 12, 2020, and vice versa.**

Here are some other things to watch out for:

Data replication compromising data integrity: Continuing with the example, imagine you ask your international counterparts to verify dates and stick to one format. One analyst copies a large dataset to check the dates. But because of memory issues, only part of the dataset is actually copied. The analyst would be verifying and standardizing incomplete data. That partial dataset would be certified as compliant but the full dataset would still contain dates that weren't verified. Two versions of a dataset can introduce inconsistent results. A final audit of results would be essential to reveal what happened and correct all dates. 

Data transfer compromising data integrity: Another analyst checks the dates in a spreadsheet and chooses to import the validated and standardized data back to the database. But suppose the date field from the spreadsheet was incorrectly classified as a text field during the data import (transfer) process. Now some of the dates in the database are stored as text strings. At this point, the data needs to be cleaned to restore its integrity. 

Data manipulation compromising data integrity: When checking dates, another analyst notices what appears to be a duplicate record in the database and removes it. But it turns out that the analyst removed a unique record for a company’s subsidiary and not a duplicate record for the company. Your dataset is now missing data and the data must be restored for completeness.

What to do when you find an issue with your data
When you are getting ready for data analysis, you might realize you don’t have the data you need or you don’t have enough of it. In some cases, you can use what is known as proxy data in place of the real data. Think of it like substituting oil for butter in a recipe when you don’t have butter. In other cases, there is no reasonable substitute and your only option is to collect more data.

Consider the following data issues and suggestions on how to work around them.

Data issue 1: no data
Possible Solutions

Examples of solutions in real life

Gather the data on a small scale to perform a preliminary analysis and then request additional time to complete the analysis after you have collected more data. 

If you are surveying employees about what they think about a new performance and bonus plan, use a sample for a preliminary analysis. Then, ask for another 3 weeks to collect the data from all employees.

If there isn’t time to collect data, perform the analysis using proxy data from other datasets. 
This is the most common workaround.

If you are analyzing peak travel times for commuters but don’t have the data for a particular city, use the data from another city with a similar size and demographic. 

Data issue 2: too little data
Possible Solutions

Examples of solutions in real life

Do the analysis using proxy data along with actual data.

If you are analyzing trends for owners of golden retrievers, make your dataset larger by including the data from owners of labradors.  

Adjust your analysis to align with the data you already have.

If you are missing data for 18- to 24-year-olds, do the analysis but note the following limitation in your report: this conclusion applies to adults 25 years and older only.

Data issue 3: wrong data, including data with errors*
Possible Solutions

Examples of solutions in real life

If you have the wrong data because requirements were misunderstood, communicate the requirements again.

If you need the data for female voters and received the data for male voters, restate your needs.

Identify errors in the data and, if possible, correct them at the source by looking for a pattern in the errors.

If your data is in a spreadsheet and there is a conditional statement or boolean causing calculations to be wrong, change the conditional statement instead of just fixing the calculated values.

If you can’t correct data errors yourself, you can ignore the 
wrong data and go ahead with the analysis if your sample size is still large enough and ignoring the data won’t cause systematic bias. 

If your dataset was translated from a different language and some of the translations don’t make sense, ignore the data with bad translation and go ahead with the analysis of the other data.

How to use a sample size calculator
In order to use a sample size calculator, you need to have the population size, confidence level, and the acceptable margin of error already decided so you can input them into the tool. If this information is ready to go, check out these sample size calculators below:

Sample size calculator by surveymonkey.com: https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/sample-size-calculator/

Sample size calculator by raosoft.com: http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html

What to do with the results
After you have plugged your information into one of these calculators, it will give you a recommended sample size. Keep in mind, the calculated sample size is the minimum number to achieve what you input for confidence level and margin of error. If you are working with a survey, you will also need to think about the estimated response rate to figure out how many surveys you will need to send out. For example, if you need a sample size of 100 individuals and your estimated response rate is 10%, you will need to send your survey to 1,000 individuals to get the 100 responses you need for your analysis.

Now that you have the basics, try some calculations using the sample size calculators and refer back to this reading if you need a refresher on the definitions.
